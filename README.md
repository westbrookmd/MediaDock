# MediaDock
This is a light-weight application to control audio playback on Windows.

# Roadmap
Basic functionality I want MediaDock to have:
* ~~Start/Stop~~
* ~~Previous/Next~~
* ~~Master Volume Control~~
* ~~Window always on top~~
* ~~Save/Load settings to/from a file~~
* Add Custom Styling

# Additional Features
Extra features that would be nice for MediaDock to have:
* Background selection
* Toggle always on top
* Implement @Musictopia2's (https://github.com/musictopia2) Remote Control Nuget Packages
* Application-specific Volume Control
* Global hotkeys (hotkeys that work when the app isn't focused)

# Installation Instructions
This application is still in development and doesn't have instructions yet.
