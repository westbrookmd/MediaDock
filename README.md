# MediaDock
This is a light-weight WPF application to control audio playback on Windows.

Experimental: This application can be connected to a SignalR connection to handle remote control from nearly any device. A SignalR service is not currently being hosted for public usage of this but feel free to test this locally.

# Roadmap
Basic functionality I want MediaDock to have:
* ~~Start/Stop~~
* ~~Previous/Next~~
* ~~Master Volume Control~~
* ~~Window always on top~~
* ~~Save/Load settings to/from a file~~
* Pause/Play button toggles based on Windows media playback
* Add Custom Styling

# Additional Features
Extra features that would be nice for MediaDock to have:
* Background selection
* ~~Toggle always on top~~
* ~~Remote Control via SignalR ~~
* Application-specific Volume Control
* Global hotkeys (hotkeys that work when the app isn't focused)

# Installation Instructions
This application is still in development and doesn't have instructions yet.
